.. author_title: Product Manager Product Presentation

I joined Zalando after my dual studies of International Business Administration in 2012. Dual studies - because I worked during my studies for a big German car manufacturer and gained experiences in various departments ranging from truck sales to financial services controlling. At Zalando I started as a Project Manager for innovation and process topics at the Content Creation. The Content Creation enriches all of our products with visual and textual content. Taking the knowledge from there I started working as a Product Manager for Product Presentation end of 2013. My team works on improving the product detail page and its content. There I am responsible for the features: 360-degree view, product images, product descriptions, product videos and Shop the Look.
