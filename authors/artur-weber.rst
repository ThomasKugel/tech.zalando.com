Hi, I'm Artur and I'm product manager in the ArticleTeam responsible for any Feature regarding Article, Pricing and Customs Management. I'm at Zalando since February 2012 and very excited about the open minded work atmosphere making it a lot of fun to contribute to Zalando's success. Besides, living in Berlin is always thrilling! And when it comes to take some time off, I board a plane and fly as far away as possible ;)
