Hi everyone! I’m half-Peruvian/half-German, originally from Frankfurt, but have been living in different parts of the US (Miami, Philadelphia, Boston, NYC) over the last 17 years. I recently moved to Berlin and I’m truly loving this city! There is plenty to explore in terms of culture and history, and it’s easy to get out and go to a big park or lake. A tech enthusiast, I'm responsible for several HR-topics at Zalando Technology.
