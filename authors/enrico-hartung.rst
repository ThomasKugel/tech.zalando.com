Hi! I'm Enrico. When I started at Zalando I still had to explain to my friends what we are doing and that the idea of selling shoes online is not absurd. My passion for software development started at the age of 13, when I learned programming on a Robotron computer. That might be late compared to other geeks around here, but I think I caught up pretty well since then. After studying informatics and working for two other startups I am now proud to be responsible for test engineering and release management at Zalando.
