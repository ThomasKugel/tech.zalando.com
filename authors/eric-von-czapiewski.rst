Hi, my name is Eric and I'm heading the Business Intelligence department at Zalando. After a few years in a consulting company I started in early 2010 with
the setup of BI (Team, Systems, ...) at Zalando. Today we as BI are providing an essential service for nearly all business departments within Zalando and are one of the
Zalando Technology pillars.
