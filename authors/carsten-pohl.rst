For as long as I can remember I have been into computing. When I was a kid computers were the futuristic thing that would in my eyes change the world some day. Today it is one of the most complicated tools that humanity has ever build, and working with it is challenging.When I am not doing that, I like to travel around the world, and meet fascinating people.
