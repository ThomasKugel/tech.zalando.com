Hi, Iâ€™m Sven and I am a Frontend Developer addicted to HTML5 and CSS3. I had the opportunity to work on several Projects at Zalando like the Shop-Page itself, the TechBlog and many more.

I really love working with HTML and CSS and it is always challenging to get the best out of HTML and CSS. I am most interested in creating clean markup and prefer  to implement features using only CSS when possible.
