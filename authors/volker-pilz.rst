Hey folks! I have started to get in touch with the whole startup craziness in 2006. My first stop: studiVZ - a social network which was supposed to become the largest of its kind in Germany at this point of time. In 2010 I joined Zalando for the first time. One of my first tasks at Zalando was to replace Magento with a self-coded Java based web shop. I was leading the Shop Development Team and watched Zalando growing and growing. I finished my first Zalando chapter after two years to widen my startup horizon and joined two other startups: ecogood and Dealgecco. In 2012 I started to work for Fielmann Ventures in Hamburg, the internal incubator and think tank of one of the biggest eyewear retailers worldwide. But: You always meet twice! After this intense journey the time has come for me to go back where I had my best time in my professional career: I'm back at Zalando to write the second chapter of my story here. As Head of Engineering my team and I take care of everything tech-related in our Shop.
