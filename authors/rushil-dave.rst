.. type: text
.. author_title: Product Manager - Mobile Apps

I joined Zalando in the beginning of 2010 after a 2 year work experience in South America. I traversed different teams and roles: server administrating SysOp, customer facing Shop developer and backend Order team member. Eventually I became the Platform/Software team lead in 2012. As a Technical Lead for the Platform/Software team I'm responsible for all platform (cross-module) software topics such as common libraries, internal tools, shared components, guidelines, deployment and continuous delivery.
