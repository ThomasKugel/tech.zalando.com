Aloha! I've been working at Zalando since March 2012 and it was a major shift leaving the C# and .NET backend world behind to become a full-time Node.js / CoffeeScript / JS / CSS3 / HTML5 / whatever-frontend developer. And I must say I never had so much fun developing as I have now :-) The result? Check out our open-source System App, and more tools should follow soon.
