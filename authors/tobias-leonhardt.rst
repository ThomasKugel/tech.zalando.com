Hi, I’m enabling people and teams here at Technology in managing projects, product- and software development. That’s means that I’m teaching, training and coaching a lot. I’m a very hands on person and so I support or take over in planning, aligning, moderating and leading. I find myself in many teams, projects and all kind of challenging situations and enjoy the growth that brings. I facilitate continuous improvement wherever I can and make collaboration easier by providing a common (project) management framework and language.
