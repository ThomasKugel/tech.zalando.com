Hi there! Here at Zalando Technology, I am responsible for the operations team, which ensures that the entire department runs effectively and efficiently through guidance, streamlined processes and the definition of compliance standards. As the management's extended workbench, we work across functions on a number of strategic projects and initiatives. With extensive international experience working with technology start-ups (e.g. I stayed six years in Tokyo, the Japanese Mecca for high-tech enthusiasts) and a background in information technology and digital media, I very much enjoy contributing to Zalando's success in such a fast-paced and cutting-edge environment.
