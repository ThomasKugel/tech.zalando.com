Hey, I'm Marcus, a product manager in the Backend Logistics Team, taking care of Zalando's logistics backbone: ZALOS. Here at Zalando, I enjoy being at the pulse of the good's flow in our big Erfurt logistics center. That's where I can make the difference by designing software and processes that help operations deliver orders to our customers as quick as possible.
