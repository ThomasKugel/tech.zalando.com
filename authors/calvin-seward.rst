Hi! I'm a data scientist currently focusing on Zalando's warehouse operations. At Zalando's multiple warehouses, thousands of employees work daily to ensure that customers receive their orders as quickly as possible.  Therefore, any boost in efficiency, be it through better routing strategies, more efficient storage methods or optimal division of labor, translates into huge savings for the warehouse, Zalando, and ultimately for the customers.

Getting from the desire to boost efficiency to an actual concrete algorithm that saves money is what I do.  Once an inefficient warehouse process has been identified and understood, I use the tools of data science, statistical modelling and numerical simulation in order to deliver algorithms, business strategies or software that results in real savings.  Every project is different, so each of my posts will showcase exciting new problems, ticks and solutions in warehouse logistics.
