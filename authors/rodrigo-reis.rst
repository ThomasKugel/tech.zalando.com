Hi, I’m Rodrigo! I’m a Java developer on the platform team here at Zalando Technology. I grew up in Portugal, with my family from the Azores – a volcanic archipelago midway between Europe and North America.My fascination with computers started at age 7, when my father bought home a Xerox 820 microcomputer. Even today I still feel that same excitement as a Java developer that I felt as a boy when I started to discover the world of computers.I moved to Berlin in late 2012 – and I have come to absolutely love this city! It’s very international, which makes it easy to meet people. Living costs are low. And best of all, it has plenty of heavy metal bars for me and my friends to headbang at. :-)
