Hi, I'm Simon. I'm a software engineer in the payment processing team in Dortmund, the world's football capital ;). I am originally from the beautiful Sauerland, but moved to Dortmund because of education at the age of 16. Because of my passion for the blogosphere, I enjoy reading and writing blogposts about cutting-edge technologies. Outside of work, I love going to the movies, riding my bike and reading books on programming.
