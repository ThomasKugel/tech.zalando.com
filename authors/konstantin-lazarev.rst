Hi, I'm Konstantin. I'm a product manager in Logistics outbound here at Zalando. I was born and lived for the longest part of my life in Ekaterinburg, Russia until I started to study in the end 2006 in Dresden.I live in Berlin since 2012 and work at Zalando for about a year. I must say, I enjoy both a lot :-)
