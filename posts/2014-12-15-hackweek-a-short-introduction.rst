HackWeek 3 starts today so it is now my pleasure to give you a short introduction what
hackweek is and what will happen at Zalando Technology in the next days.

.. TEASER_END

The idea
========

If I have to to explain hackweek in one sentence, I always say it is the google friday but for 
a week. The topics that we are working on are ranging from new navigation types, virtual 
reality dress rooms, trying on clothes digitally, robots, internal tools or experimenting with 
new technologies. The topics are quite good but the most important thing in this week is the 
atmosphere of innovation, freedom and motivation that is feelable in all zalando tech facilities.

The process
===========

pitching: 3 weeks before every hackweek the ideas board is opened. This is a place where you 
can place your own concepts or find projects that you would like to support. In these 3 weeks 
we additionally have pitch sessions where you can advertise your project personally to find 
other people to join your projects.

hacking: Then during the week all regular work stops and everybody is working on their 
projects. Besides that we have a lot of social activities like a office mini golf or foosball 
tournament.

rewarding: The best of the hackweek is the final presentation where every team presents theit 
results. You see every three minutes a new project that makes you speechless. At the end the 
best teams get awards in different catgories like 
So that was a short introduction, now i have to join my team aswell. ;-)
