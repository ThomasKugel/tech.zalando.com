Awarded for the most creative and innovative presentation.


Presentations start this afternoon and each project team has the opportunity to show what they were able to develop throughout this week. As there are too many ideas to be introduced, each presenter has to pitch precisely in a timeslot of just two minutes.
Afterwards, the victory ceremony will take place. You can already feel the anticipation. It will be exciting to see who climbs the winners podium and wins one of those trophies in the end. Last but not least, an amazing HackWeek closing party will take place tonight :-) We will keep you updated. Just keep watching our blog (@ZalandoTech).
